        <h4>What does the buffer do?</h4>
        <p class="small">When you're estimating a software project, you're making a lot of educated guess. The buffer is just a way to build a little cushion into your estimates. When you add a buffer to your projects, it adds your your buffer percentage to your total estimated hours to calculate the total estimated hours for the project.</p>

        <h4>How are my hours imported from Harvest or Toggl?</h4>
        <p>For Harvest</p>
        <p class="small">Albatross will match your project name with the project name in Harvest (so make sure they match exactly). Categories in Albatross match tasks in Harvest. Then Albatross matches line items to notes in Harvest to pull in hours for each item.</p>
        <p>For Toggl</p>
        <p class="small">Albatross will match your project name with the project name in Harvest (so make sure they match exactly). Categories in Albatross match with tags in Toggl. Then Albatross matches line items to descriptions in Harvest to pull in hours for each item.</p>
